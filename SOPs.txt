Setup
-----

cd to top folder

On windows:
>>> python -m venv .venv           # create virtual environment
>>> .venv/Scripts/activate        # activate virtual environment

You may have to select the Python interpreter in the .venv folder. In VSCode:
View > Command Palette > Python select interpreter -> enter interpreter path 
(.venv/Scripts/python.exe)

Install requirements:

>>> pip install -r requirements.txt


Note: the documentation needs to follow the published package, so 
avoid installing vreg-package from source as this risks including 
unpublished methods in the docs.


Build documentation locally
---------------------------

>> cd docs
>>> ./make html

To see the docs, open: ./docs/build/html/index.html

To make all autogenerated documentation from scratch, first delete all auto-generated content:

- delete docs/build
- delete all folders inside docs/source/generated/


Updating the website
--------------------

- Push your latest changes to docs-miblab-data/main. This will automatically 
build and deploy the docs on openmiblab.gitub.io/docs-miblab-data..
